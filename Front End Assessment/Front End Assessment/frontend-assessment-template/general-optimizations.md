# Q7: Frontend Performance Optimizations

List at least three techniques to optimize a frontend application for performance.

Your answer here.

1. **Optimize assets:** compress images, use modern formats like WebP/AVIF, and load only the required resolutions.
2. **Lazy loading / code-splitting:** load components or scripts only when they are needed to reduce initial load time.
3. **Caching & CDN:** serve static files through a CDN and leverage browser caching for faster delivery.
4. **Critical CSS & minification:** load essential CSS immediately and minimize CSS/JS to reduce file sizes and improve render speed.
